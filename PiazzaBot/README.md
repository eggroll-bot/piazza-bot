# Piazza Bot

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress. ðŸš§

A Discord bot created to retrieve Piazza posts when a message with a word beginning with a 'p' shows up.

Planned Tasks:

- Create a Piazza API that allows for querying post titles and post body. Integrate the API with the bot.

- Add a search command that will search for a certain Piazza post by user, post title, or post body (requires the Piazza API).
