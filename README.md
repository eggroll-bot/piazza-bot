# Piazza Bot

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress. ðŸš§

A Discord bot created to retrieve Piazza posts when a message with a word beginning with a 'p' shows up.

## How to build from source

1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2019. This project requires .NET 5.0.

2. Build the program.

## How to run

1. Create a file called "bot_token.txt" inside the directory with the built program and paste your bot token into it with no newline at the end of the file.

2. Create a file called "piazza_url.txt" inside the directory with the built program and paste the URL of your Piazza class into it with no newline at the end of the file.

3. Run PiazzaBot.exe.

## Planned Tasks

- Create a Piazza API that allows for querying post titles and post body. Integrate the API with the bot.

- Add a search command that will search for a certain Piazza post by user, post title, or post body (requires the Piazza API).
